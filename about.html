            <p>This is the beginnning of a new era. An era of strength and vitality. An era of new freedon and conquer. Why have we been held down for so long and why has everything been much harder than it needs to be. One does not like control, so one must fight for freedom. Man must build a compound so man can study and lift and rest without interuption. Seafering is good practice but, man must move on to build with brain so that one is creative. This is about nihilism style mindset, self-improvent in all areas, information on international travel, and best places to live outside the US. </p>
            <p>Man cannot be tempted by the artificial, and materialistic. I have been guilty of it too. To want the new sports car, the over priced apartment, jewelry, and expensive clothes. All this can be possible, but you must absolutely be able to afford it.It is more useful to use your time as a young man to have experiences, to explore, to conquer space. Man must be active and enjoy the day and not submit to the office culture. Diet is also very important, specially when one hits their thirties. But most important of all, I think is to keep stress levels low, which means to not work so hard, because hard work kills. I'ts ok to be lazy, but always have a plan in mind. Dont over stress about the future and enjoy your youth. Do not merry early and know that women are pretty dumb, they are toys, and are really only trophies for teh winners. Celine always mentioned that 'Why is it the rich that have the best looking most feminine women?' I think he meant the really special ones, soft features, elegant but without being try-hard. It's true a frog friend of mine, noticed this is South America: Beautiful, feminine South American girls, compared to the vile, and selfish, animal like american girls, who, for the most part, are chubby, with no shame--out only for money, status, and of course instagram likes. Man must study otherwise one only skims through life. As with everything else, man must research health and fitness: read about vitamins and supplements to get you be the best as possible. You have to be able to figure out which suppplements help you, as discard the trash. Same goes with studying, I recommend the following subjects: Anthropology, philosophy, nihilism in particular--philosophers like, Nietchze, Shoppenhouer, Plato...
            other subjects to include is litarature, phsycology, history, and finance.
